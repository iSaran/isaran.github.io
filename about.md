Hi, I am **Iason Sarantopoulos** and this is a blog contemplating with robotics
research, engineering, software and other obscure topics.

I received my Diploma degree (BEng/MEng) from the Dept. of Electrical and
Computer Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.
Currently I work as a researcher in Robotics, while pursuing my PhD in the same
department.

My research interests lie in non-linear systems, control algorithms, real time
embedded systems, software engineering, reinforcement learning and its
applications in robotics and particularly in object grasping and manipulation
by robotic fingers.
