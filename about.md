Hi, I am **Iason Sarantopoulos** and this is an *open source* blog contemplating with robotics research, engineering, software and other obscure topics.

I received my Diploma degree (BEng/MEng) from the Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. Currently I work as a researcher in Robotics, pursuing my PhD.

My research interests lie in non-linear systems, control algorithms, real time embedded systems, software engineering and its applications in robotics and particularly in object grasping and manipulation by robotic fingers.

If you want to contact me, please do so here:
